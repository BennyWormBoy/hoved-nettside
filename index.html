    <p> Author's note: <br> I watched <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Z2wsRyjJIw_ZdQMwmEUQ3ZYKkpxOq3H&si=9r_lB6MOl-gjCSX0">Secret Sleepover Socity</a> play Ghost Trick. I highly recommend since the voices they chose for the 
    <br>characters were simpily on point, in my opinion of course.</p> <img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ghost_Trick_-_Gameplay_Screenshot_png_jpgcopy-2.jpg?fit=720%2C404&p=1">
