    <img src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1967430/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1712636235">

    the creator of the Ace Attorney game series, Shu Takumi,
    <br>but the music was also composed by Yasumasa Kitagawa, known for composing for Ace Attorney.</p>
    <p> Author's note: <br> I watched <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Z2wsRyjJIw_ZdQMwmEUQ3ZYKkpxOq3H&si=9r_lB6MOl-gjCSX0">Secret Sleepover Socity</a> play Ghost Trick. I highly recommend since the voices they chose for the 
    <br>characters were simpily on point, in my opinion of course.</p><hr>
